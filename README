PURPOSE

    Catch the Furball is published for two reasons:

    1: To provide an icebreaker board game something like Generica
       ( http://JonathansCorner.com/etc/generica ) in which it is not necessary
       to create a board and cut up boards, but rather can be played
       immediately through an attractive web interface.

    2: To make the engine for the above mentioned game available so that people
       can create their own analogous games.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

    Basics

        * Run "./install" and answer the questions provided.  This will
          run a Unix-flavor install script and should create
          a working, out-of-the-box installation when supplied
          appropriate values.

        * Edit the privacy policy, stored in
          <the public Catch the Furball HTML directory>/privacy.html, so that
          its contents are appropriate to your site.

        * See USAGE below if are curions about how to use Catch the Furball.

        * The install script is not meant to fully customize Catch
          the Furball, only to get it running.  See Customization below for
          further information on how to adjust Snippets to meet your needs.

        Customization

            To customize the content of pages, edit the configuration file at
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory>/config and set
            "edit_is_enabled" to "yes" (no quotation marks) and "edit_password"
            to a value other than its default of "xyzzy". Then visit the
            script's usual URL with "?edit=yes" added to the end, and log in.
            You will be at a web interface that will allow you to edit the
            script's content with the same power as was used to create it.

            If you wish to create a game with completely new cards, pictures,
            etc., you can clean the slate by deleting
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory/pickled/data.immutable
            and going to edit as described in the paragraph above.

            For other configuration, The configuration file at
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory>/config is
            commented and can be adjusted to control how the script works.

            The beginning and ending of a page are read from
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory>/page_header and
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory>/page_footer
            respectively.  Editing those files provides an effective way to
            customize page appearance: colors, for instance, may be changed by
            editing the CSS in the page header.

            The images used for various purposes are found in
            <the public Catch the Furball HTML directory> and may be replaced
            with images tailored to your site's needs.

        Security

            The present release of Catch the Furball has not been closely
            scrutinized for security, and should be treated as such by
            security-conscious administrators.  If you discover a
            vulnerability, please contact the author at
            jonathan.hayward@pobox.com with details.

            The default installation sets
            <the private Catch the Furball data directory> and contents
            to a relatively permissive mode.  Administrators are encouraged to
            set directory and contents to mode 700, owned by the
            effective user ID that CGI scripts will be running under. This
            is usually apache or nobody.

USAGE

    Catch the Furball is designed to be run as a straightforward web
    application, with much administrative activity performed on-web.
    Rather than trying to explain how to use it, I simply encourage you
    to explore. To play Catch the Furball, go to:

        http://[your hostname]/cgi-bin/furball

    To edit it, go to:

        http://[your hostname]/cgi-bin/furball?edit=yes

    (That is the location provided by RPM installation and the default for the
    provided installer. The provided installer allows you to specify another
    location; if you specified another location, substitute that for
    "/cgi-bin/furball".)
